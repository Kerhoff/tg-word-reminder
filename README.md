## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Create a configuration file:**
   Create a `config.json` file in the root directory of the project with the following structure:
   ```json
   {
       "database": {
           "host": "your-database-host",
           "user": "your-database-user",
           "password": "your-database-password",
           "dbname": "your-database-name",
           "port": "your-database-port",
           "sslmode": "require"
       },
       "telegram": {
           "token": "your-telegram-bot-token"
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Run the bot:**
   ```bash
   go build ./cmd/tg-word-reminder
   ./tg-word-reminder
   ```

## Usage

You can send a CSV file with word pairs to the bot to upload them. Please refer to the example file `example.csv` for the correct format.

- **Commands:**
  - `/getpair`: Get a random word pair.
  - `/clear`: Clear all uploaded word pairs.
  - `/setnum <number>`: Set the number of pairs to send in reminders.
  - `/setfreq <number>`: Set the frequency of reminders per day.

## Database Setup

The bot uses a PostgreSQL database. Ensure that the database is set up and accessible based on the configuration provided in `config.json`. The bot will automatically create the necessary tables for storing word pairs and user settings.

## Logging

The bot uses the standard library's `slog` package for logging. Logs will be printed to the console.
